/*	procedure: (read) or (read port)

	Read converts external representations of Scheme objects
	into the objects themselves. That is, it is a parser for the
	nonterminal datum (see sections 7.1.2 and 6.3.2). Read
	returns the next object parsable from the given input port,
	updating port to point to the first character past the end
	of the external representation of the object.
	
	If an end of file is encountered in the input before any char-
	acters are found that can begin an object, then an end of
	file object is returned. The port remains open, and fur-
	ther attempts to read will also return an end of file object.
	If an end of file is encountered after the beginning of an
	objectâ€™s external representation, but the external represen-
	tation is incomplete and therefore not parsable, an error is
	signalled.
	
	The port argument may be omitted, in which case it de-
	faults to the value returned by current-input-port. It is
	an error to read from a closed port.
