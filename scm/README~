How to use:

	1. First you should install the Boehm-Demers-Weiser gc. http://hboehm.info/gc/

	2. type make.

	3. type ./interp

	4. type (load "init.scm")

	5. If you want to test, type (load "test.scm")
	

Todo:

	1. No support for big number, float number, complex number and fraction.
	
	2. Only a limited call/cc functionality.
	
	3. I use the gc library to reclaim useless memory.
